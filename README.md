# Launchpad
Launchpad is a dynamic web application tailored for university students and recent graduates seeking career opportunities. Built with Python, Flask, JavaScript, React, and MongoDB, this platform enables users to effortlessly upload resumes and cover letters in PDF format, apply for internships and full-time jobs, and communicate directly with employers. Offering a streamlined job application process, Launchpad bridges the gap between talented individuals and their dream careers.

## Running Backend

1. Clone repo
2. Go to launchpad_backend directory `cd launchpad_backend`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` Mac (if the first one didn't work): `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python run.py` in terminal
5. Navigate to http://localhost:5001/ on your browser to see app locally

## Running Frontend

1. Clone repo
2. Go to launchpad-frontend directory `cd launchpad-frontend`
3. Run `npm install` in terminal to install all required dependencies
4. Ensure backend server is running (see above)
5. Run `npm start` in terminal
6. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on your browser to see app locally

## Running MongoDB UI to see and edit data (Optional)

All interaction with the db is through the backend so this step is not neccessary but it makes things easier when you want to see all the data and if you want to try editing data quickly

1. Install MongoDB with default settings: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. Ensure backend server is running (see above)
3. In MongoDB, establish a new connection with URI mongodb://localhost:27017/database

The Mac setup is a bit different, here is what some of us followed to get it set up

## Logging In

You can log in by either signing up for a new account and using those credentials, or logging in with the credentials of an existing account.

There are 2 existing accounts. Those are recommend to be used for testing purposes as they already have existing data on them as opposed to a new account, such as job applications sent and notifications.
